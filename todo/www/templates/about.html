			<h1>Rolls-Royce in Indiana</h1>			
			<p>Our facilities in Indianapolis are home to the largest Rolls-Royce manufacturing location in North 
			America. As one of the largest employers in Indianapolis, we employ approximately 4,000 people in central
			Indiana.</p><br>
			<img src="img/Rolls-Royce Image 1.jpg" class="ataglance">
			<p><strong>Made in Indiana</strong><br>Our employees in Indianapolis design, develop, and manufacture key 
			products in the Rolls-Royce portfolio, including the AE 3007 for Embraer’s regional jet, the Citation X and 
			existing defense programs such as Global Hawk. The AE 2100 powers the Lockheed Martin C-130J and the C-27J. 
			The AE 1107 powers the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft and the M250 engine powers a variety of 
			helicopters including the Bell 206 and 407. Indianapolis is also key to Rolls-Royce’s participation in the 
			F-35B program. Our components for the F-35B, including the Rolls-Royce LiftSystem®, are assembled near 
			Indianapolis. The Rolls-Royce LiftSystem®, enables short take off and vertical landing (STOVL) operations
			for the supersonic capable F-35B.</p><br>
			<p><strong>Award Winning Engineering</strong><br>Our employees from Indianapolis have made major contributions
			to several projects that have won the prestigious Robert J. Collier Trophy over the course of the last 15 years, 
			highlighting the advanced nature of the work undertaken at the site. The Collier Trophy is presented annually 
			“For the greatest achievement in aeronautics in America.” The award has been called the greatest and most prized 
			of all aeronautical honors in the United States.</p><br>
			<p><strong>Indiana Origins</strong><br>Indianapolis was formerly the headquarters of the Allison Engine Company,
			a descendant of the company formed by James Allison on September 14, 1915. James Allison also founded the 
			Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Rolls-Royce purchased Allison in 1995, but the association between the two companies 
			stretches back to the 1920’s when Allison licensed Rolls-Royce to make bearings. </p><br>
