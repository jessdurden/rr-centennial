			<h1>Rolls-Royce in Indiana</h1>
			<img src="img/about/about1.png" class="ataglance">			
			<p>Rolls-Royce facilities in Indianapolis are home to the largest Rolls-Royce manufacturing location
			in North America.  One of the largest employers in Indianapolis, the company employs approximately
			4,000 people in central Indiana.</p><br>
			<p><strong>Made in Indiana</strong><br>Employees in Indianapolis design, develop and manufacture 
			key products in the Rolls-Royce portfolio, including the AE 3007 for Embraer’s regional jet, the Citation
			X and existing defense programs such as Global Hawk.  The AE 2100 powers the Lockheed Martin C-130J and 
			the C-27J.  The AE 1107 powers the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor and the Model 250 engine powers a 
			variety of helicopters including Bell 206 and 407 helicopters.  Indianapolis is also key to Rolls-Royce 
			participation in Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). Components for the propulsion system for the F-35B Joint 
			Strike Fighter program are assembled in Indianapolis.  The Rolls-Royce LiftSystem® enables short take off 
			and vertical landing (STOVL) operations for the supersonic capable Joint Strike Fighter.</p><br>
			<p><strong>Award Winning Engineering</strong><br>Personnel from Indianapolis have made major contributions 
			to six projects that have won the prestigious Robert J. Collier Trophy over the course of the last 15 years,
			highlighting the advanced nature of the work undertaken at the site.  The Collier Trophy is presented annually,
			“For the greatest achievement in aeronautics in America."  The award has been called the greatest and most 
			prized of all aeronautical honors in the United States of America.</p><br>
			<p><strong>Indiana Origins</strong><br>Indianapolis was formerly the headquarters of the Allison Engine Company, 
			a descendant of the company formed by Jim Allison on September 14, 1915, who also founded the Indianapolis 
			Motor Speedway.  Rolls-Royce purchased Allison in 1995, but the association between the two companies stretches
			back to the 1920s when Allison licensed Rolls-Royce to make bearings.</p><br>

			companies in the world.  More Rolls-Royce engines are built in Indianapolis than anywhere else in the world.</p><br> 
			<p>Rolls-Royce is making major investments in the United States because America can compete in the global 
			marketplace. Rolls-Royce will double its production capability over the next 10 years in order to meet its 
			global order book of $96 billion (£60.1 billion) for civil aerospace, defense aerospace, marine and energy 
			products. The investments the company is making in America will ensure we continue to deliver excellence 
			for our customers.</p><br>

			for high-value vessels.</p><br>
			<p>The Indianapolis-produced MT7 marine gas turbine – a marine variant of the AE 1107C has been selected to 
			power the US Navy’s new Ship-to-Shore Connector (SSC) hovercraft built by Textron Marine & Land Systems.  In
			addition, Indianapolis supplies RR4500 generator sets that power the US Navy’s new DDG-1000 (USS Zumwalt) 
			multi-mission destroyers and has been designed to meet all U.S. Navy requirements.</p><br>
